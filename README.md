# Single Page Responsive Web
Responsive single page website capturing the beauty of Norway.

Single Page Web was created using HTML, CSS and JS. This page can be divided into four main parts (top part, explore part, photo part and part with map).

Under the Top "Welcome" part there is a swiper with iconic places. Below the swiper you can see photos and under it there is a map (map was created using MyMaps by Google).
